//---- The following corporations are friendly with NanoTrasen and loosely enable trade and travel:
//Corporation NanoTrasen - Generalised / high tech research and phoron exploitation.
//Corporation Vessel Contracting - Ship and station construction, materials research.
//Corporation Osiris Atmospherics - Atmospherics machinery construction and chemical research.
//Corporation Second Red Cross Society - 26th century Red Cross reborn as a dominating economic force in biomedical science (research and materials).
//Corporation Blue Industries - High tech and high energy research, in particular into the mysteries of bluespace manipulation and power generation.
//Corporation Kusanagi Robotics - Founded by robotics legend Kaito Kusanagi in the 2070s, they have been on the forefront of mechanical augmentation and robotics development ever since.
//Corporation Free traders - Not so much a corporation as a loose coalition of spacers, Free Traders are a roving band of smugglers, traders and fringe elements following a rigid (if informal) code of loyalty and honour. Mistrusted by most corporations, they are tolerated because of their uncanny ability to smell out a profit.

//---- Descriptions of destination types
//Space stations can be purpose built for a number of different things, but generally require regular shipments of essential supplies.
//Corvettes are small, fast warships generally assigned to border patrol or chasing down smugglers.
//Battleships are large, heavy cruisers designed for slugging it out with other heavies or razing planets.
//Yachts are fast civilian craft, often used for pleasure or smuggling.
//Destroyers are medium sized vessels, often used for escorting larger ships but able to go toe-to-toe with them if need be.
//Frigates are medium sized vessels, often used for escorting larger ships. They will rapidly find themselves outclassed if forced to face heavy warships head on.
