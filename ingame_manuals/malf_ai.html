<h1>Malfunctioning AI guide</h1><br>

This guide contains most important OOC information for malfunctioning AIs.<br>

<h2>Goal</h2><br>
As malfunctioning AI, your primary goal is to overtake station's systems. To do this, use software "Basic Encryption Hack" on APCs (right click on APC and select Basic Encryption Hack). Please note that hacked APCs have distinctive blue error screen, that tends to attract attention. Rememember that malfunctioning AI is antagonist, so read server rules for antagonists. While hacking APCs is your official goal, feel free to create custom goal, as long as it is fun for everyone.<br>

<h2>Hardware</h2><br>
As the malfunctioning AI, you may select only one hardware piece to help you. Remember that once you select a hardware piece, you cannot select another one, so choose wisely! Hardware may be selected by clicking the "Select Hardware" button in the Hardware tab. The following is list of possible hardware pieces:<br>
<b>APU Generator</b> - Auxiliary Power Unit. Allows you to operate even without external power. However, running on the APU will stop your CPU time generation, and will temporarily disable most of your abilities. The APU is also somewhat vulnerable to physical damage, and will fail if your core hardware integrity drops below 50%.<br>
<b>Turrets Focus Enhancer</b> - Removes safeties from installed turrets, boosting their rate of fire, health and enabling nano-regeneration module. However, this increases power usage considerably, especially when regenerating damage.<br>
<b>Secondary Processor Unit</b> - Simple upgrade that increases your CPU time generation by 50%. Useful if you need to speed up your research.<br>
<b>Secondary Memory Bank</b> - Doubles the amount of maximal CPU time you may store. This is useful if you need to use lots of abilities in a short amount of time.<br>
<b>Self-Destruct Explosives</b> - Large blocks of C4 will be attached to your physical core. The C4 has a 15 second timer, and may be activated by special button that appears in your Hardware tab. The C4 will remain active, even if you are destroyed. If the timer reaches 0 your core explodes in a strong explosion. Obviously, this destroys you, as well as anyone nearby.<br>

<h2>Software</h2><br>
Software are abilities that have to be unlocked via the research menu (Hardware tab). Unlocked abilities appear in the Software tab. <b>Sometimes, abilities won't appear in this tab after being researched. This can be fixed by relogging or using the "ai-core" command.</b> Abilities are tiered, T1 being the weakest ones, while T4 are the strongest ones. To reach higher tiers you have to research abilities in lower tiers. We currently have 12 abilities, in 3 research trees:<br>
<b>Networking</b> - Hacking-oriented abilities. The T1 ability is the Basic Encryption Hack, which allows you to hack more APCs. Higher tiers allow faking CentComm messages, and even setting alert levels. The T4 ability is System Override, which rapidly hacks remaining APCs and gives you access to station self destruct sequence.<br>
<b>Interdiction</b> - Sabotage-oriented abilities. The T1 ability allows you to recall the emergency shuttle. Higher level abilities allow you to unlock cyborgs even without access to the robotics console, and the T4 ability allows you to hack other AIs to slave them under your control.<br>
<b>Manipulation</b> - Physical-oriented abilities. The T1 ability allows you to break few lights, and rarely even APCs. The T2 ability allows you to apply an upgrade of your choice to a camera, or reactivate a broken camera. The T3 ability allows you to create weak forcefields that hold air, but they won't last for long. And the T4 ability allows you to overload machines, detonating them in a weak explosion.<br>
