Examples which require a changelog entry include:
* Adding/removing objects that players may interact with, or the way they function.
* Adding/removing/altering admin tools.
* Changing the map.

Examples were changelog entries are optional/not typically required:
* Cosmetic changes such as descriptions, sound effects, etc.
* Optimizations and other changes to underlying systems which do not affect gameplay.
* Minor bug fixes.

You find a README and example file in .\html\changelogs\ for further instructions.
